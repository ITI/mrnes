// The general approach we use is to convert a MrNesBits representation of the network
// into the data structures used by a graph package that has built-in path discovery algorithms.
// Weighting each edge by 1, a shortest path minimizes the number of hops, which is sort of what
// local routing like OSPF does.
//   The network representation from MrNesbits represents devices (Endpt, Switch, Router), with
// a link from devA to devB being represented if there is a direct wired or wireless connection
// between them.  After a path is computed from device to device to device ... we discover the identity
// of the interface through which the path accesses the device, and report that as part of the path.
//
//   The Dijsktra algorithm we call computes a tree of shortest paths from a named node.
// so then if we want the shortest path from src to dst, we either compute such a tree rooted in
// src, or look up from a cached version of an already computed tree the sequence of nodes
// between src and dst, inclusive. Failing that we look for a known path from dst to src, which
// will by symmetry be the reversed path of what we want.

// ShowPath returns a string that lists the names of all the network devices on a
// path. The input arguments are the source and destination device ids, a dictionary holding string
// names as a function of device id, representation the path, and a flag indicating whether the path
// is from src to dst, or vice-versa
